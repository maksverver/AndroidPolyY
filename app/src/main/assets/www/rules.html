<h1>Rules of Poly-Y</h1>

<p>Poly-Y is an abstract board game for two players, <b class="color-red">red</b> and <b class="color-blue">blue</b>. The standard
board has 5 sides and 5 corners, and consists of 106 fields, as shown below. Most fields connect to
6 neighboring fields, except for the fields at the edge of the board, and the center field, which
has only 5 neighbors.</p>

<p><b>Game play:</b> Players take turns placing stones of their color on empty fields.
Corners of the board can be captured by connecting the two adjacent sides with an arbitrary third
side, creating a <b>Y</b> shape. The player that captures at least 3 of the 5 corners of the board
wins.</p>

<p class="small">(It can be shown that each corner can be captured by only one player,
and that eventually all corners of the board will be captured, so ties are impossible.)</p>

<p>In the example above, red has captured the top corner by connecting the adjacent top-left and
top-right sides with the bottom side of the board.
Meanwhile, blue has captured two corners on the left side of the board.
Note that the corner fields count as connecting to both adjacent sides,
so blue's stones on the left connect three adjacent sides.</p>

<p><b>Pie rule:</b>
With just the above rules, the starting player would have a large advantage.
To balance the game, there is one more rule: after the first player places his first stone,
the second player may replace that stone with one of her own color (but only on her first turn!).
This forces the first player to choose a first move that is neither too strong nor too weak.</p>

<p><b>Game modes:</b>
This app supports two game modes.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <b>campaign</b> mode, you play against an AI whose strength depends on your current level.
When you win a game, your level increases, and when you lose, it decreases.
Try to get your level as high as possible!</li>
<li>In <b>custom</b> mode, you can create arbitrary games for practice.
Winning or losing these games does not affect your campaign level, so feel free to experiment!</li>
</ul>
