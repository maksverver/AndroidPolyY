GameActivity accepts intent extras to override the game state, which is useful for testing.
Example:

% adb shell am start-activity ch.verver.poly_y/.GameActivity -es override_game_state "1,7,5,0"

The game state strings can be found in the SharedPreferences file, and are also logged to logcat:

% adb logcat -s GameRegistry
