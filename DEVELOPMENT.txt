GameActivity accepts intent extras to override the game state, which is useful for testing.
Example:

% adb shell am start-activity -n ch.verver.poly_y/.GameActivity --es override_game_state "1,7,5,1,0" -S

The game state strings can be found in the SharedPreferences file, and are also logged to logcat:

% adb logcat -s GameRegistry


To benchmark the AI on the phone:

% adb shell am start-activity -n ch.verver.poly_y/.BenchmarkActivity --el duration_ms 5000 -S

(The duration_ms extra is optional.)

For reference: I get around 2300 expansions/second on qemu, and around 1800 on my
Samsung A52 (though around 2300 too if I run for only 100 ms; the CPU probably
has some kind of burst mode.)
